I decided that i wanted to simultaneously develop a RogueLike in C++ using BearLibTerminal during
the Roguelike dev codealong, so i put this together after dinner tonight. it's at the same
stage of development as the swift versionk, all be it a touch buggier (imagine that...) and 
the tunnel/room laying algorithim isnt running as nicely in c++, though i had to change
several things to make it work AT ALL. gonna read up on a couple more proc gen algo's and perhaps
give them a whirl tonight.
